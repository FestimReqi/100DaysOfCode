## 🗓️ Daily Log Template

### Day 1 – [25 May 2025]

✅ **What I Did:**

- Built a small project called **Random Quote Generator** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Created an array of quotes and used `Math.random()` to display one randomly
- Used DOM manipulation to display the quote and dynamically show the current year in the footer

📚 **What I Learned:**

- How to use `Math.floor()` and `Math.random()` to generate random results
- How to manipulate the DOM using `getElementById()` and `textContent`
- How to retrieve and display the current year using `Date` objects

❗ **Challenges:**

- Remembering to structure the JavaScript properly to run after DOM load
- Managing function calls and avoiding duplicate logic (noticed duplicate `getNewYear()` calls)

💡 **Plan for Tomorrow:**

- Learn and practice `if/else` statements, comparison operators, and boolean logic
- Apply conditionals in a small interactive project (like a number guesser or age checker)
