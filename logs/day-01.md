### Day 1 – [25 May 2025]

✅ **What I Did:**

- Built the **Random Quote Generator** project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Created a list of quotes and used `Math.random()` to display a random one
- Manipulated the DOM to dynamically show the selected quote and the current year in the footer

📚 **What I Learned:**

- How to use `array`, `Math.floor()`, and `Math.random()` to generate random content
- How to manipulate DOM elements using `getElementById()` and `textContent`
- How to use `Date` objects to retrieve and display the current year

❗ **Challenges:**

- Managing function execution and event handling (`onclick`, `DOMContentLoaded`)
- Making sure JavaScript runs after the HTML is loaded and functions are initialized properly

💡 **Plan for Tomorrow:**

- Explore `if/else` conditions, comparison operators, and boolean logic to build conditional functions
